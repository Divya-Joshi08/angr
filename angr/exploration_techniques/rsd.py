''' hiiiii
class RSD(ExplorationTechnique):

setup():
    make the static control dependence graph

step():
    i think we can use their implementation

selector():
    maybe we can use this to not step redundant states ? 

Questions:
- when is the dynamic control dependence graph constructed?
